							<h2>A (very) brief history of the rental crisis</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Around the Nixon years,</strong> wages stopped keeping up with the cost of living.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wages-vs-prod.jpg" alt="a graph shows how wages stopped growing in the 70s while productivity continued to rise dramatically." /><br><p>Ballooning rents are still included in the gross domestic product even though nothing is produced by scalping a home.</em></p></span>

							<h2>Isn't it just a supply-demand problem?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>On a supply-demand graph,</strong> prices are expected to stabilize if supply stays the same.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/supply-demand.png" alt="a classic supply-demand curve showing equilibrium between supply and demand." /><br>
								<p>But what if someone -- or someones -- reduced the amount of affordable housing by regularly scalping it? "With all other variables held equal," as economists often say, if quantity of an available good is reduced (by being sequestered in investment portfolios, for example), prices rise.</p>

							<h2>Middle-men create supply problems.</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								<strong>Landlord-free housing cooperatives rent housing at around 1/2 of "fair" market rate.</strong></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/vienna.webp" alt="a classic supply-demand curve showing equilibrium between supply and demand." /><br>
								<p>Vienna bought a ton of housing back from local and foreign rent speculators and successfully reduced market-rate rents by ~50%.<br>
								<br>
								Tenants are used to paying off landlords' 2nd, 22nd, or 2222nd mortgage for them. What if that money instead went toward creating permanently affordable rental housing?

							<h2>One possible fix (the short version)</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>The "dissolving equity land trust" emerges as a unique solution in this environment.</strong></p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/rent-graph-simpler.webp" alt=""/><br>
								<p>1. Make a down payment.<br>
								<br>
								2. Give tenants a 30-50% rebate on their mortgage payments.<br>
								<br>
								3. Once the home is paid off, the current tenants pay them back.<br>
								<br>
								4. Future tenants also get a rebate -- just a slightly smaller one.<br>
								<br>
								6. Repeat this process until the rebate reaches 0%.<br>
								<br>
								7. By the time the rebate is 0%, rent is ~1/2 of prevailing market rate.
