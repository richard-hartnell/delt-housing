            <h4 class="a">The dissolving-equty model makes affordable housing more available by, in short,
                reimbursing tenants for the money they put into the equity over time, as opposed to just 
                handing that money to a private landlord.
                <br>
            <i>How do you do that?</i>
            <h4>Inspired by the COVID-19 lockdown's "flattening of the curve," the DELT works to address the 
                problem of the expensive buy-in for housing cooperatives by distributing mortgage payments not over 
                20-30 years, but over 60+ years, making mortgage payments relatively inexpensive for tenants.

        <h3 class="q">Don't landlords provide housing?</h3>
        <h4 class="a"><p>That's a common meme. But in economic terms, nothing is "produced" when someone 
            buys a good and then resells it for a higher price. In that sense, market-rate housing is only 
            "provided" after it is removed from the market as affordable housing.
        <p><i>But isn't that like any other business?</i></p>
        <p>Not when coffee roasters produce coffee, luthiers make musical instruments, or construction 
            companies build housing -- or when service providers fix your plumbing, produce a show, or 
            troubleshoot your computer.</p>
            <p><i>But what about other rental businesses?</i></p>
            <p>One thing sets housing rental apart from other types of rental: you don't need a wood chipper, 
                beach cruiser, or wedding pavilion to live. However, going without permanent housing is 
                frequently illegal, typically harmful, and often fatal. In fact, it's exactly this 
                principle that lets rent speculators extract tens of thousands of dollars from people 
                who simply can't afford a down payment.</p></h4>
