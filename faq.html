            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>How does this work?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">We pay back residents for any money they put toward the equity, rather than pocketing 
                all that equity like a private rent speculator.<br>
                <br>
                <i>How do you do that?</i><br>
                <br>
                If residents move in before the mortgage is paid off, half of their rent is considered a <i>loan</i> 
                to the home, and a part of future residents' rent will pay them back later.<br>
                <br>
                <i>OK, but who pays back *those* residents?</i><br>
                <br>
                Great question! Answer: future residents.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Doesn't that make a kind of pyramid-ish scheme?</i><br>
                <br>
                It kind of would! That's where the "dissolving" part of the dissolving-equity model works: every 
                later generation of residents gets paid back a little less for their payments toward the 
                initial purchase price. This might seem unfair, but rent gets adjusted downward in a DELT 
                so by the time some residents aren't getting paid back, their rent is so low that it doesn't matter.<br>
                <br>
                In short, everyone's rent in a DELT ends up being somewhere around 1/2 of the market rate 
                established by private landlords (whether giant corporations or an army of "moms" and "pops").<br>
                <br>
                <i>Does it pay interest?</i><br>
                <br>
                No, not right now, sorry. It's more like a rebate. But it still saves tenants a lot of money over time 
                that they would have otherwise just handed off to someone richer than them (probably).

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>So who pays for stuff like repairs?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">The same people who always pay for repairs in rental housing: tenants! The other half 
                of tenants' rent in a DELT, the part that doesn't get paid back, goes to the real operating 
                cost of housing: utilities, property tax, repairs, rainy-day funds, insurance, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Wait, these low prices for DELT rent are inclusive of utilities?</i><br>
                <br>
                Yes.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Are the market-rate rents priced inclusive of utilities?</i><br>
                
                <br>
                No.</h4>

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>What happens if you have to evict someone?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">Nothing stops residents in a DELT from asking someone to leave if they become hostile 
                or stop paying rent or something. They would follow normal eviction procedures like any small landlord 
                would.<br>
                <br>
                That said, a DELT is also resilient to personal crises (like a resident losing their job, or 
                getting sick or injured such that they can't work). Because a portion of each resident's rent is actually 
                a loan to the DELT, an established DELT can provide short-term rent amnesty by simply forgiving a piece 
                of that resident's debt (for as long as it exists).<br>

        <hr>
        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>How do you start a DELT? Where's the down payment come from?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">The eternal question, and the leverage that so many private landlords hold over their tenants: 
                how to make a downpayment? The short version is "the same way any private landlord would," by hustling up 
                business investors or ponying up money out of savings. It's easier, in fact, when tenants would be paid back 
                any money they put toward a downpayment.<br>
                <br>
                Alternately, an existing DELT could leverage its current equity against a mortgage in the same way that a 
                private landlord would. If a DELT already owned a half-million-dollar house, it could leverage this holding 
                against a second property, which could then be leveraged against a third -- the same way commercial landlords 
                do it, but without sequestering the working tenants' equity payments in an "investment" portfolio forever.<br>
                <br>
                Municipalities, non-profits, and other groups could also consider raising grant money for a DELT. While some 
                people consider this "socialism," for some reason those people don't call it "socialism" when working tenants 
                are socializing the equity payments of the owning class...<br>

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>Isn't a DELT just another kind of landlord?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">Welllllll........ yes, kind of. You got us!<br>
                <br>
                We're using the term "landlord" as shorthand for "commercial landlord," i.e. a private rent speculator
                who is using surplus housing to generate a profit. They do this by considering the mortage an "expense" while 
                tenants are paying it off, but call it "their investment" after it's paid off. They also run the house, which 
                often means that tenants have no control over how or when their repair bills are settled. Many of us have had 
                the experience of calling in a complaint about utilities, damage, etc. just to have the landlord ignore it, 
                or somehow mismanage the repair (whether doing a bad job, or calling a bad contractor).<br>
                <br>
                On the other hand, as a land trust, a DELT is generally run by the tenants. You could even set up a DELT as a 
                nonprofit whose board of directors is defined as "all the current tenants." That means instead of calling a landlord 
                who may or may not call the plumber (and may or may not evict you for complaining), you can just use your own home's 
                repair fund to call your own plumber (or, if you're handy enough, fix it yourself and keep the repair money!). Most 
                importantly, a DELT doesn't pocket your equity payments -- it returns them to the people paying for them. In that sense, 
                a DELT could be loosely considered "landlord-free" housing, similar to a co-owned home.<br></h4>

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>OK, I'm in. How do I join?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">Right now the DELT is a theoretical model, something to present to city and state governments 
                that want to facilitate something like the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=vienna+model">Vienna Model</a>.
                <br><br>
                A city could allocate funds to put money down on rental housing, then operate it as a DELT.<br>
                <br>
                A bunch of friends with liquid funding could put money into a DELT, and then get it back over time.<br>
                <br>
                Someone who already owns housing could turn it into a DELT and get paid back for all their equity, 
                and then following residents could get paid back for paying back the original owner.<br>
                <br>
                Etc!<br>
                <br>
                (hopefully, someday this website will have a list of DELTs that you could apply to live in. future goals!)

            <h4 class="a">Sorry, but no. Buying an affordable product and then re-selling it at a much higher price is not 
                "providing" anything to anyone.
