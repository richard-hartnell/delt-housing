            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>How does this work?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">We pay back residents for any money they put toward the equity, rather than pocketing 
                all that equity like a private rent speculator.<br>
                <br>
                <i>How do you do that?</i><br>
                <br>
                If residents move in before the mortgage is paid off, half of their rent is considered a <i>loan</i> 
                to the home, and a part of future residents' rent will pay them back later.<br>
                <br>
                <i>OK, but who pays back *those* residents?</i><br>
                <br>
                Great question! Answer: future residents.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Doesn't that make a kind of pyramid-ish scheme?</i><br>
                <br>
                It kind of would! That's where the "dissolving" part of the dissolving-equity model works: every 
                later generation of residents gets paid back a little less for their payments toward the 
                initial purchase price. This might seem unfair, but rent gets adjusted downward in a DELT 
                so by the time some residents aren't getting paid back, their rent is so low that it doesn't matter.<br>
                <br>
                In short, everyone's rent in a DELT ends up being somewhere around 1/2 of the market rate 
                established by private landlords (whether giant corporations or an army of "moms" and "pops").

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>So who pays for stuff like repairs?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">The same people who always pay for repairs in rental housing: tenants! The other half 
                of tenants' rent in a DELT, the part that doesn't get paid back, goes to the real operating 
                cost of housing: utilities, property tax, repairs, rainy-day funds, insurance, etc.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Wait, these low prices for DELT rent are inclusive of utilities?</i><br>
                <br>
                Yup!</h4>
        <hr>
        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>What happens if you have to evict someone?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">Nothing stops residents in a DELT from asking someone to leave if they become hostile 
                or stop paying rent or something. They would follow normal eviction procedures like any small landlord 
                would.<br>
                <br>
                That said, a DELT is also resilient to personal crises (like a resident losing their job, or 
                getting sick or injured such that they can't work). Because a portion of each resident's rent is actually 
                a loan to the DELT, an established DELT can provide short-term rent amnesty by simply forgiving a piece 
                of that resident's debt (for as long as it exists).<br>

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>OK, I'm in. How do I join?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a">There are several ways to establish a DELT, and as more come to exist it will 
                be easier to join them.<br>
                <br>
                You could push your city council to allocate public funds toward housing. If a city were to buy 
                a home and establish it as a DELT, not only could the city recoup its purchase price but it wouldn't 
                have to do so at the expense of its tenants.<br>

        <div class="question">
            <a href="#" class="q"><h3>Don't landlords provide housing, though?</h3></a>
            <h4 class="a"><p>That's a common meme. But in economic terms, nothing is "produced" when someone 
            buys a good and then resells it for a higher price. In that sense, market-rate housing is only 
            "provided" after it is removed from the market as affordable housing.
            <p><i>But isn't that like any other business?</i></p>
            <p>Not when coffee roasters produce coffee, luthiers produce musical instruments, or construction 
            companies build housing -- or when service providers fix your plumbing, produce a show, or 
            troubleshoot your computer.</p>
            <p><i>But what about other rental businesses?</i></p>
            <p>One thing sets housing rental apart from other types of rental: you don't need a wood chipper, 
                beach cruiser, or wedding pavilion to live. However, going without permanent housing is 
                frequently illegal, typically harmful, and often fatal. In fact, it's exactly this 
                principle that lets rent speculators extract tens of thousands of dollars from people 
                who simply can't afford a down payment.</p>
            <p>Rather, let's consider the "rental business" analogy like this: let's say you live in a place where 
                you need a car or truck to get by. Imagine a bunch of bank-backed 
                fatcats swoop in, buy up nearly every affordable car in town, and your only option (unless you have $10k 
                right now) is to rent a car for hundreds of dollars each month. That's what we're doing with housing.
