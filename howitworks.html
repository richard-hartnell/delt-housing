							<h2>A truly affordable rental housing model</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>The quest for sustainable, affordable housing</strong> has never been more urgent in the face of escalating housing crises worldwide. The Dissolving Equity Land Trust (DELT) emerges as a groundbreaking model in this landscape, using a dynamic mathematical model inspired by <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/economic-growth/regional-development/housing/2023/02/vienna-model-social-housing">the Vienna Model</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve">COVID epidemiology</a> to create fairly priced rental housing available to people in need.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/wages-vs-prod.jpg" alt="a graph shows how wages stopped growing in the 70s while productivity continued to rise dramatically." /><p><em>Wages have been frozen relative to productivity since the Nixon years. Notably, <strong>ballooning rents are still included in GDP even though nothing is produced by scalping a home</strong>.</em></p></span>

							<h2>FEATURES OF A CO-OP</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>"Landlord-free" rental housing</strong> (such as a renter's cooperative) has a number of really nice features.</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon solid fa-bolt">Utilities included in already-low costs</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-signal">Rent escalates slowly, not quickly</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-cog">Faster, cheaper repairs</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">Progressive, not regressive, rents</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">No surprise evictions</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-map-marker-alt">Keeps money in the community</li>
							</ul>
							<p>However, there is <strong>one major drawback to the cooperative model: the problem of equity payments</strong>. While cooperatives dramatically reduce month-to-month rents,  they often require expensive buy-ins. This puts cooperative housing out of reach for working-class tenants who need affordable housing the most.</p>

							</div>
							<br>
							<p><strong>The DELT solves this equity dilemma</strong> by distributing equity payments among a much larger number of tenants.</p>

							<h2>LIFE OF A DELT</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>The DELT has a three-phase life cycle</strong> that reduces effective rents to roughly one-half market rate compared to contemporary commercial rentals.</p>
							<br>
							<p>In a traditional rental model, first you pay back the creditors. Then you pay the creditors for having loaned you money. Then you do that forever.</p>
							<br>
							<p>In a DELT, you pay back the creditors. Then you pay back the people who paid the creditors. Then you're done paying creditors, and you can just enjoy cheap rent forever.</p>

							<!-- Section -->
							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>1. The initial phase</h3>
									<p>Initial buyers front capital to buy a place, and tenants allocate around 50% of their rent to paying off the downpayment and/or mortgage. However, <strong>unlike traditional rentals, tenants are issued a future rebate for the portion of their rent that pays off home equity</strong>.</p>
									<!-- <p>At the inception of a DELT, someone buys a house and gives it to a <em>trust</em> (an organization that exists solely to own the property). This trust could be a city, or a housing nonprofit, or even your own nonprofit whose board of directors is defined as "all current housemates." Then, that trust leases these properties to tenants (like a regular housing coop). Like traditional rentals, around half the rent goes to paying off the purchase price of the home.</p>
									<p>However, unlike traditional rentals, <strong>tenants are issued a future rebate for the portion of their rent that pays off home equity</strong>.</p> -->

							</section>

						<section>
							<header>
								<h3>2. The dissolving phase</h3>
								<p>Next, the DELT starts paying back all those rebates.</p><p><strong>The rebate offered to tenants slowly goes from 50% to 0% over several years</strong> (so we don't make a pyramid scheme).</p>

								</div>
							</div>
						</section>

						<section>
							<header>
								<h3>The end phase</h3>
								<p>Eventually, the home is paid off and the rebates are all done. The DELT is now financially solvent, holding home equity in trust.</p>
								<p>While nobody receives a rebate for paying off the house anymore, <strong>rent in a mature DELT hovers around one-half of market rate (or possibly less)</strong>.</p>

							<p><strong>These graphs show</strong> the DELT at work. The top graph shows rent over time; the red line shows market-rate rent continuing to double every decade, with the blue line showing the relatively slow escalation of the cost of homeownership (rising tax or utility payments, etc).<br>
							<canvas id="rentCanvas" width="400" height="400"></canvas>
							<br>
							<strong>The DELT in green</strong> shows the place where the magic happens: rent is held higher than base cost, but as soon as the equity is paid for then the rent accelerates at a dramatically lower rate than commercial rents, eventually converging with a cost like that of homeownership.</p>

							<p><strong>The second graph</strong> shows debt over time in DELT vs. for-profit rentals. At market-rate rents (red line), tenants quickly pay off the mortgage with no returns.<br>
								<br>Since a DELT (green line) is writing IOUs as it also pays off a home loan, its debt increases in the early years. But despite below-market-rate rents, it still pays off its debt over time.</p>
