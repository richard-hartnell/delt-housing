# The Dissolving Equity Land Trust
## a fairer housing model that would reward, not exploit, tenants for paying off rental housing equity
### (working title)

This is a cooperative housing model that I'm building right now in JS.

It tries to solve the problem of expensive co-op buy-ins by establishing rental housing that, to simplify, offers shares of equity to tenants who pay for the equity but then automatically buys those shares back from tenants.

As it uses future tenants' funds to repay that equity, it also repays future tenants for their work paying off previous tenants. This share slowly decreases for each further generation of tenants.

This model, when fine tuned, ends up offering rent at roughly 1/2 of market rate to every generation of tenants -- whether they are early tenants paying off the mortgage, late tenants who don't have to pay for any equity, or tenants in between.
